I think our visualizer looks pretty cool. It also has a lot of options for the the user to select.
We added a bunch of circular thinks for the visualizer, and we added some some things for flowy waveforms.
We have all the requirements for Media.
Our code builds on what we did in class, furthering it by adding more options.

If we had more time, we would add more interesting things for the waveforms.

We deserve an 100% because if this was someone else's visualizer, we would vibe hard to it. The rainbow colors add a lot to it.
